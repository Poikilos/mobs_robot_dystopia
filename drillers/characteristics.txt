It only attacks hostile mobs, but, if he provoked, he will resort to attacking you, so, don't attack. please...

So basically, i will add the skins and you will make the code, just put a random scrap skin, but basically they:
*Attack each other and any other mobs and players
*Die in lava and water
*They drop drills
*They will fall over Minecraft-style
*They have baby versions
I hope somebody can make this for me.
And i found a cool mod that i want somebody to make a Magma Driller for:
