## Differences in Poikilos' fork
- The releases are in version control.
- The license information is more complete and correct.
  - The invalid citation to mobs redo is removed--stop citing that, its
    an API!
  - The incorrect author for the "default player model"
    ("Nathan Salapat") is replaced by the correct authors (MirceaKitsune
    and stujones11:
    <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minetest/minetest_game/master/mods/player_api/README.txt>)
