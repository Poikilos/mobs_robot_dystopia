# [modpack] Robot Distopia Mobs [mobs_robot_distopia]
<https://github.com/poikilos/mobs_robot_distopia>

This is a fork of [[Modpack] The Mobpack
[mob_pack]](https://forum.minetest.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=14822>), but
with a name (and many other aspects) that are less ambigous, and soon
to be less redundant (It is technically imported from
(<https://bitbucket.org/TailsTheFenniken/mob_pack> but that is an empty
repo with versions in the Downloads area).


## Differences in Poikilos' fork
- See progress at: [issues](https://github.com/poikilos/mobs_robot_distopia/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
- The releases are in version control.
- The license information is more complete and correct.
  - The teletron code uses the BlockMen zombie as a reference, but the
    code is not a derivative since CME is an API. Get over it,
    BlockMen.
  - Other mobs are no longer all said to be based on Snapper, since mobs
    redo is an API. Modders, stop saying your mob is "based on" another
    mob or on mobs redo or other APIs--an API is what you are using and
    every def will look the same: will you cite every mob ever? No.
    - The author is TTFYT not "Snappers...azekill_DIABLO" for trash_can
      code.
    - The author is TTFYT not "Snappers...azekill_DIABLO..for trash_can"
      for tailstheanimatronic code.
  - The withered_tails (ambiguously called "*teletron*" something)
    license ambiguity is resolved. The incorrect citation "Zombie model
    derived from the default player model by Nathan Salapat" and
    ambiguous citation for the "...teletron" as "Nathan Salapat" is
    replaced by the correct authors (MirceaKitsune and stujones11 for
    the player model in some mods; them and Nathan Salapat for the
    zombie models based on the player model in withered_tails).
    - The teletron model is unrelated to withered_tails
      ("Withered teletron/TTA") and is rather the BlockMen zombie model
      from CME.
    - The "default player model" (character.b3d) itself is not among the
      upstream Nathan Salapat models (hence not in withered_tails), but
      is in the drillers and tailstheanimatronic mods. Here is the
      license:
      <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minetest/minetest_game/master/mods/player_api/README.txt>)
  - The forum thread is considered authoritative as far as authors go,
    since author lists in the code are copypasta from Snappers (code
    and comments which azekill_DIABLO wrote while helping create the
    modpack).
- Make indentations uniform.
